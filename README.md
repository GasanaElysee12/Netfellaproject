# Netfellaproject
This project aims at addressing the problem of assigning unique code to the product rather than having same codes for different products which are in the same category, adding specification, and removing duplicate using AI supporting tools in the E-procurement system.
To run the codes, do the following:

0. Install python to your computer, at least version above 3.10.
1. Install the required packages on your computer.
2. Download .py file and folder for Data.
3. Run this command on your termanal or powershell:  `streamlit run streamlit2.py`.
4. This will create a `URL` to be pasted in a browser when you can run the task.
